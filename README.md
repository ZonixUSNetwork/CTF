# CTF
A basic capture the flag plugin which includes most of the core mechanics. This plugin has a few unfinished features such as team upgrades, however they shouldn't affect gameplay.

This plugin was written for the Zonix Network by Kansio, but was open sourced after we decided to close the server

Dependencies:
- Kotlin
- Proton (A qLib fork.)

You can do whatever you want with this plugin.
